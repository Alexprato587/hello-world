I am a student (22), currently learning C#. 
I quickly studied through HTML, CSS and JavaScript just to learn it didn't quite fit my desired role (oops, although I'd love to come back and master it another day)

Without missing a beat I am back again to do things right and get comfortable with C# and the basics such as Git (hence this first ever post).
Alongside C# I have taken an interest in learning to use Unity (fun, but quite a lot of information to retain while vigorously also studying C#).

I have no idea what to do with myself after I finish getting comfortable in C#.
Looking for friendly communities that have time to help integrate a newbie into the world of development and answer ridiculous questions! :joy:
